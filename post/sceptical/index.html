		<h5>The Sceptical Patriot: Highlights</h5>
	  </div>

	  <div class="post">
		<p>I recently read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sceptical-Patriot-Exploring-Truths-Glories-ebook/dp/B00K35G7ZO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404020995&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+sceptical+patriot">The Sceptical Patriot: Exploring the Truths Behind the Zero and Other Indian Glories </a> and thought it was one of the best books I have read in the recent past. We&rsquo;ve all been part of patriotic email chains ( when that was a thing) and now patriotic posts on Facebook extolling the greatness of our ancestors and their many path breaking contributions without which modern society would be lost.</p>

<p>This book takes an unvarnished look at some of the most famous and widely propogated India Facts and examines them through an unbiased lens backed by facts as best the author can find, which we learn throughout the book can be a suprisingly hard thing.</p>

<p>I thought the best way to evangelize the book would be to share my highlights. These are equal parts hilarious, profound, refreshing, irreverent and seemingly accidently educational. So without further ado here they are:</p>

<p>A word of caution: These are my highlights and may not adequately represent the entire context, so please do yourself a favour and read the whole book.</p>

<p><em>The Sushruta Samhita is, to put it mildly, mind-blowing. It is astonishing that while the existence of this text is taught to most Indian school
 children, the contents are often ignored. It describes, for instance, 76 types of eye-diseases, 121 sharp and blunt instruments used in surgery, 42 surgical processes and 700 plants of medicinal value divided into 37 groups of diseases.What other pioneering techniques does the Sushruta Samhita explain? An English translation seems well worth the investment. There are free ones on the Internet.</em></p>

<p>There, starting of the on the right foot.</p>

<p>India has never invaded another country in its glorious <strong>10,000</strong> history right ?</p>

<p><em>I’m really hoping that this information sends your jaw crashing to the floor and somersaulting out of the door. Yes, an empire based in Tamil Nadu once used to rule over vast chunks of Southeast Asia! (I hope you’re not thinking of Java, the computer programming language. That is not the Java I am referring to. Though, of course, many people would say that a vast empire of Tamils, spread out across the world, rules over that other Java too.)</em></p>

<p><em>How utterly inaccurate. As any resident of the region will tell you, intercourse is not only rare but almost universally forbidden across most of South India. Instead, locals are encouraged to spend their lives in prayer and IIT coaching.</em></p>

<p><em>You, my reader, live closer in time to Rajendra Chola III than he did to the first Chola kings. Think about that.</em></p>

<p><em>The numbers eka [one], dasa [ten], sata [hundred], sahasra [thousand], ayuta [ten thousand], niyuta [hundred thousand], prayuta [million], koti [ten million], arbuda [hundred million], and vrnda [thousand million] are from place to place each ten times the preceding.</em></p>

<p>making decimal system possible. nbd.</p>

<p><em>Aurangzeb was both a great administrator and a ruthless expansionist. Which, on the face of it, seems like a good thing for the Mughal Empire. Under him, the empire and its system of revenue collection became a cash-generating machine. Unfortunately, Aurangzeb was also a religious nut-job and a divisive jerk who pissed off nearly everybody in the empire by the time he died in 1707.</em></p>

<p><em>An astonishing £90 billion, in today’s money, was written off without so much as a fiscal burp. Thus nicely preparing the Indian peoples for the future invention of Air India.</em></p>

<p><em>Millions of people in both countries live without access to food, water, shelter, education or the latest Apple products.</em></p>

<p>Sone ki chiddiya ?</p>

<p><em>This new narrative of Indian colonial economy has been my greatest learning in the course of this Sceptical investigation. To me, it seems that the British Empire’s economic crime was not making a rich country poor but taking a somewhat moribund economy and keeping it that way while the rest of the world whooshed by. The story of how that crime took place is interesting, infuriating and a little depressing. And not at all meant for this book.</em></p>

<p><em>It was audacious because Marconi set up a company that would make and sell radio equipment despite having technology that was experimental at best, intellectual property of dubious originality, and practically no clients. Its roots may have been precarious, but in one form or the other this company would last for more than a century.</em></p>

<p>Something for the western audience here :</p>

<p><em>The extremely Eurocentric nature of Christian art and scripture might give you the impression that Jesus was a gorgeous chestnut blonde with milky-white skin who spoke in flawless Latin. But in reality, he was probably a sunburnt chap, roaming around a sunburnt land, speaking Aramaic, the lingua franca of the time. All thanks, in large part, to the Achaemenid decision around 500 BCE to make Aramaic the official administrative language of the empire.</em></p>

<p>Laugh first, reflect later, forget immediately.</p>

<p><em>After their presentation, the Hibakusha asked the children: Should countries go to war? No, they all said in chorus. Should countries use nuclear weapons? No! Should India use nuclear weapons? Never! What if the enemy is Pakistan? Oh, Pakistan is a special case, the kids said, we should totally nuke them. Every time I retell this story at a public forum, there is an explosion of laughter…followed by an awkward silence. These were primary school students—children too young to be taught any serious history in school, children much too young to appreciate any aspect of India’s complicated relationship with Pakistan. And yet, these children had no hesitation in picking out Pakistan for a nuclear attack. Pakistan, to these tiny, partly formed minds, was already a special case—the great enemy. Somehow, we’ve managed to create a social, cultural and political environment in which even our youngest citizens have been so deeply indoctrinated to hate. Who else, I wonder, have we indoctrinated them against? Little Muslim kids against Hindus? Little Hindu kids against Muslims? Little Dalits against all Yadavs? Still, the people who manage our school curricula feel no need to actually teach them any aspect of post-Independence Indian history. This, despite the fact that the last six decades of Indian history have so much to tell us about the tensions that currently determine our political and social existence. Why should each generation be brought up on the selective prejudices of the one before it? I believe that this is exactly the point of history. And not just reading or studying history but also approaching it with a sceptical bent of mind. When each generation approaches received wisdom with scepticism, perhaps it will reassess established notions of right and wrong, love and hate. Perhaps it will finally see mistaken priorities for what they really are. Perhaps it will do something that previous generations steadfastly refused to do.</em></p>

<p><em>I am not suggesting that history or scepticism by themselves can provide all the answers to all these questions. History, after all, is not a forward-looking discipline. It can only tell us what happened the last time, not what will happen next time. Similarly, scepticism is hardly sufficient to do anything but ask questions. But together they—history and scepticism—form a potent force for enquiry.</em></p>

<p><em>Are you writing this to prove that a lot of Indian people are idiots? Or is there a greater point?’ No doubt, there are many people here who feel that all this is a load of liberal, the-world-is-one-big-family nonsense. That this is the kind of hippie-nonsense that makes nations weak and citizens unpatriotic. Perhaps. But only when you reduce the idea of identity, patriotism and humanity to its crudest line-in-the-sand form. Indeed, a true Indian, an Indian cognizant of the frenzied history of his or her past, must be proud not of his or her identity but of the utter lack of identity. We carry in our blood not pure Hindu, Muslim or Christian platelets. On the contrary, an entire planet’s worth of history courses through our veins.</em></p>

<p><em>the average Indian does not need the expensive equipment or complex education of a genetic scientist to appreciate this lack of identity. He or she just needs to look into his or her lunchbox. Yet, just six hundred years ago, the aloo gobi was unheard of in India, not because it was some sort of state secret, but because potatoes, tomatoes and green chillies simply didn’t exist. The potato, tomato and green chilli are all vegetables that originated in South America and were brought to Europe by Spanish conquerors as part of what is now known as the ‘Columbian Exchange’—a process by which South Americans gave the world a number of culinary treasures, and in return got enslaved and murdered.</em></p>

<p>Well that escalated quickly .</p>

<p><em>Think about that for a second. In less than one century, an entire country, with about eighteen per cent of the world’s population and impossibly diverse culinary cultures and preferences, went from looking at the tomato with suspicion to consuming it with absolutely everything. Now, there are two ways of looking at this. You can lament the ease with which we allow our ‘culture’ to be diluted. You can reject the foreign and glorify the native. You can lionize our ‘Indian’ history—whatever that means—draw a line across a period in time and reject everything that came afterwards. Or you can celebrate our ability to absorb. From Greek invaders to Persian architecture to South American tomatoes—we absorbed everything. We integrated them deeply into our culture and identity and history.</em></p>

<p><em>This is going to piss off a lot of people, and I am buying asbestos underwear as I type, but…we need to stop asking the history of centuries past to vindicate our actions today. History is not a manifesto for action, a list of crimes to be avenged, a litany of positions to be reversed or a collection of rights to be wronged. No, really. Why not just say: ‘You know what? Maybe I should be seeking justice for the future rather than seek justice for the past&hellip;’? Just an idea. Or we can keep killing each other.</em></p>

<p>Lets end on a good note.</p>

<p><em>But most of all, we need a society that refuses to conform, that refuses to put up social, political and ideological borders. Perhaps, we need to go back to being the great cultural sponge that we once used to be. Maybe then, we will stop harking back to our glory days and a long list of dubious ‘India facts’, and create a few new ones.</em></p>

<p>I hope you had a good laugh and will decide to spend a couple of hours reading the fascinating book and making your conclusions about what it has to say.</p>
