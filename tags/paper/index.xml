      <description>&lt;p&gt;I dropped into the CS240 lecture at Stanford this week and they were discussing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html&#34;&gt;The Rise of Worse is Better&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a  very short paper and infact not very technical at all barring one example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main point the author, Richard Gabriel tries to make is that simplicity wins over correctness, completeness and consistency which was contrary to what many people at MIT believed at the time. He talks of C and Unix being viruses which survived because they were easy to acquire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of this include: the fork/exec model in *nix as opposed to windows and the PC-loser-ing problem mentioned in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
